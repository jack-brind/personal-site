          <h2>Preface</h2>
          <p>
            Most designers write about success stories — design projects that
            shipped, metrics that soared, glowing customer feedback. And it
            makes sense right? Why would you write a case study and pitch
            yourself to would-be hiring managers without showing them how good
            you are?
          </p>
          <p>Well, this isn't one of those stories.</p>
          <p>
            This is about a project I spent over 18 months working on — a
            complete redesign of itris recruitment CRM — that never launched. It
            was my chance to redeem past design mistakes, apply a decade of
            experience sharpening my design skills and product sense, and build
            something I could finally be truly proud of. And then it got
            cancelled.
          </p>
          <p>
            This isn't a series of traditional case studies. Not really, anyway,
            because let's be honest, most cookie cutter case studies are kind of
            dull. Packed with diagrams of the Double Diamond Methodology and
            neatly packaged Design Thinking infographics walking us through
            empathise, define, ideate, prototype, and test. Not to mention Bob,
            the persona that was made up as your ideal user. Does anyone really
            read these? I certainly don't. So this is more a story with some
            case study content sprinkled in. More of a fly on the wall, behind
            the scenes piece. It's a story of growth, written across multiple
            articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            This series is about what I learned — not just about product design,
            but about letting go of something you'd grown attached to. Why a
            series, you ask? This project was huge; too long for one article.
            This first entry sets the scene and context. Think of this series as
            a tasting menu. And this article? The amuse-bouche.

          <h2>Where it all started</h2>
          <p>
            Many a designer, regardless of domain, will know the feeling of
            looking back at your earlier work wincing like you've just bitten
            into a lemon.
          </p>
          <blockquote>Did I really think that was good?</blockquote>
          <p>
            I've been a product designer for over a decade. I landed my first
            job when I was fresh out of university having picked up a Bachelor's
            degree in Philosophy. Unlike many of my university friends who had
            completed accounting and finance degrees or computer science
            degrees, I couldn't really see myself becoming a Philosopher for a
            living.
          </p>
          <p>
            After exactly 9 days of freedom in-between university and real-life
            (i.e. getting a job), I joined a software company that was looking
            for someone to work on a fixed-term contract for 12 months
            re-writing the documentation for their product. To write the
            documentation, I had to learn the product and I would consistently
            stumble across things that were inconsistent, awkward, clunky and
            then some things that just simply didn't work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recall one scenario where I clicked on a button in a settings
            screen and nothing happened. I asked the lead developer to look into
            it and let me know what it is supposed to do.
          </p>

          <p>
            And there it was — my first baby step into product design. Over the
            course of the next few months, I was trusted to come back with more
            suggestions for improvements that formed part of a short initiative
            to improve parts of the UI. The improvements were a drop in the
            ocean, but it lit a spark I didn't expect — I really enjoyed it.

          <h2>A brief history of itris Recruitment CRM</h2>
          <p>
            The product was called itris — a Recruitment CRM, established in
            1998. Built to be the operational backbone of recruitment agencies,
            at its core, it combines the functionality of a sales tool,
            Applicant Tracking System (ATS), and Customer Relationship
            Management (CRM) solution into one platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speed and accuracy is everything in recruitment. The faster a
            recruiter can respond to a job or match a suitable candidate, the
            more likely they are to succeed. That need for speed shaped a lot of
            the product's early design decisions, as did the fundamental focus
            on accuracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I joined, the flagship version was itris 8. It was released in
            2008 and the design was heavily influenced by Windows Vista with a
            lot of skeuomorphic glossy buttons and beveled edges. It was built
            in Delphi (which, I'm told, was pretty popular back in the day),
            using a SQL database for data storage — very cutting edge if you're
            into early-2000s throwbacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it was showing its age, and the market was moving on.
            Competitors were gaining ground, and a big decision needed to be
            made — one the CEO would later call "one of his biggest regrets."
            (We'll get to that).
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="article-content">
          <h2>Enter itris 9</h2>
          <p>
            Around the time I joined, there were murmurs of re-writing the
            entire product from the ground up using a more modern stack - C# and
            WPF and there had been some background work going on behind the
            scenes to accommodate this new product. Towards the end of 2014,
            when the articles had been largely re-written, and after having
            shown my value, I was presented with the opportunity of staying on
            and being the company's first dedicated designer.
          </p>
          <p>My brief? Design the future of itris.</p>
          <p>
            It's worth noting that my experience of product design thus far was
            mostly question like "Should we make these icons a bit bigger?" and
            "Is it worth adding a little description to this section?". Equipped
            with exactly zero product sense, Microsoft Paint, and a worrying
            amount of confidence, I gave it my best shot. Looking back, I quite
            literally had no idea what I was doing. It took me at least a year
            to even discover that UX design was a thing — I was too busy
            designing things that looked cool after seeing things on Dribbble.
          </p>
          <p>
            But over time, through a mix of time and a lot of trial and error, I
            began to figure things out and it would lead to me redesigning an
            entire platform from scratch. A platform that was complex and
            already very mature serving customers around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 2016, itris 9 had began full time development and the initial
            designs that I had put together were starting to be implemented in
            code. At that early stage, I was still finding my feet and the
            design was influenced by the flat design trend, popularised by iOS 7
            and Windows Metro. From that point, the design had been established
            because, well, I couldn't feasibly keep changing it - I had to
            settle on something.

          <p>
            At first, the "design team" was just me and our Training Manager,
            who had years of customer insight. Then, in 2017, a new PM came
            onboard and introduced radical ideas like MVP, kanban boards,
            feature creep, and (brace yourself) Jira.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took 3 more challenging years to finally release the new product
            in 2020, right in the middle of a global pandemic. Perfect timing.
          </p>
          <p>
            That feeling should have been one of jubilation — celebration and
            pride in the achievement. We finally had a product that was rebuilt
            from scratch and a complete redesign. But for me, it was more of a
            strange, melancholic anti-climax. I think it was because my taste
            and design sensibilities had evolved faster than itris had.
          </p>
          <p>
            The product itself was solid—robust in terms of workflow—but the UI
            just looked… amateurish. It was too cluttered, lacked hierarchy, had
            poor contrast. Basically, despite my own hubris, I knew I could do
            better.

            Everyone else loved it. Internally, it was seen as a huge upgrade
            over itris 8. It was also

              >really well received by customers</a
            >. But I felt stuck designing in a style I no longer believed in.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's a weird place to be: when your skills and taste improve after
            the work is done, and you can see exactly what you'd do differently
            but you can't change it. Sure, I made some small incremental
            changes, but at its core, the design language was deeply rooted in
            the product and changing it fundamentally was just not commercially
            viable.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point in my journey, I had 6 or so years of experience and I
            had learned a lot. I'd gone from Microsoft Paint to Photoshop to
            Adobe Xd and amassed a tonne of knowledge and become the champion of
            design in the business. I desperately wanted to redesign it again!
            For the next few years I had to design in a style that I didn't like
            that much. It was frustrating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, the product worked well at launch, and customers really liked
            it, and they still do today. But as features grew and the user base
            expanded, more explicit limitations began to surface beyond the
            aesthetics. Interfaces became cluttered and workflows became
            over-complicated as more features and improvements were added. Some
            parts just simply didn't scale. More and more customer requests
            ended up with us saying 'hmm, we probably need to change these x
            things before we can facilitate that' - we were chasing out tail. We
            had accrued a lot of design and technical debt already, faster than
            we could pay it back.

          <h2>Where things started to break</h2>
          <p>
            To make matters more complicated, itris had always been a desktop
            product, not accessible inside a browser (which was a hard sell in
            the post Covid hybrid/remote working era) which is increasingly what
            customers and prospects wanted. Remember I mentioned the CEO's
            biggest regret? This was it - choosing to do another desktop product
            instead of a web product. We had spent years rebuilding the product
            in a desktop environment, which, at the time was still relevant
            (just about) but over time, it became clear that if we wanted to
            stay relevant, we needed to create a web front end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from the fact that it was what customers and prospects wanted,
            there were technical constraints and challenges that had plagued
            from day one. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              WPF had no native responsiveness like <code>@media</code> queries
            </li>
            <li>
              Animations were almost impossible due to WPF's single UI thread
            </li>
            <li>WPF was nowhere near as rich as HTML & CSS</li>

          <h2>A chance for redemption</h2>
          <p>
            Due to increasing demands, in 2023, the CEO made the decision to
            sanction a web client for itris. The backend was solid so this would
            be a new client layer, giving users the flexibility to work in
            either the desktop or web version. It would be less work than before
            because we were only creating a web view on top. We had some
            modifications to make in the backend to support it but compared to
            before, it wouldn't be as big.
          </p>
          <p>
            And for me, it was a perfect scenario: a second chance. Not just to
            "port" the product to the web, but to completely reimagine its
            foundations — the architecture, navigation, interactions, and
            overall experience. This time, I brought a decade of hard-won
            lessons, sharper instincts, and a better eye for what truly matters
            in product design. We didn't want a surface-level facelift. We
            wanted to rethink how itris worked, felt, and fit into people's
            daily lives. It was a chance to build something better — and,
            quietly, to prove to myself how far I'd come.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a chance to revisit my own thinking, correct my earlier
            mistakes, and approach it all with fresh eyes and a (slightly more)
            grown-up perspective. I'd learned how to make better decisions, ask
            better questions, and build systems that scale. A chance to
            simplify, streamline, and finally design the product I wish I'd
            known how to make the first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We assembled a small team of 3 - me (design), a PM and an engineer
            to think about the initial scope. We also involved the whole
            engineering team every Thursday for 6 weeks to throw our heads
            together and discuss the path forwards. Ultimately, we settled on
            using Vue.js for the front end framework and I also suggested that
            we use Storybook for the components. I would also build a design
            system to help speed everything up and introduce some consistency (I
            will write about this in an upcoming post).

            Huge redesigns for established products are a huge risk, but
            sometimes necessary. You need to make changes to facilitate growth,
            but at the same time, a dramatic change could end up alienating
            users that are comfortable. However, we had a somewhat unique
            position in that itris 9 was a desktop product and so this web
            version would be separate. Users would be able to run both versions
            side by side so they could ease into it and we'd be able to get
            feedback, similar to when Figma went from UI2 to UI3.

          <h2>The plan</h2>
          <p>
            Looking back, the hardest part wasn't choosing frameworks or picking
            colours, it was carving out time and space to rethink the
            foundations of the product itself. With just me on design and
            ongoing work on itris 9, progress was slow and sporadic. But
            gradually, we started to zoom out and make sense of what needed to
            come first.
          </p>
          <p>
            We kicked off "Web Fridays" which were dedicated sessions where the
            PM and I casual sessions where the PM and I would talk about ideas,
            untangle parts of the IA, and sketch early flows. Those
            conversations made it clear that before we could design anything, we
            had to get the structure right and approach the redesign
            systematically.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the next 18 months, we would be making good headway on the
            project and everything was looking great.

          <h2>And then everything changed...</h2>
          <p>
            In 2024, the business was acquired. Not long after, the new owners
            made a strategic decision to pull the plug on the web redesign
            entirely — choosing instead to re-skin another product they already
            owned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like that, the project I'd spent over 18 months researching,
            planning, sketching, prototyping, and nurturing… was gone.
          </p>
          <p>No big drama. No fanfare. Just a quiet full stop.</p>

          <h2>What I Took With Me</h2>
          <p>
            Was it disappointing? Of course. I'd poured so much of myself into
            that project — not just my time, but my taste, my experience, my
            growth as a designer. And to see it shelved for business reasons
            beyond my control was, frankly, gutting.
          </p>
          <p>But I don't regret a minute of it.</p>
          <p>
            That web redesign taught me more than many projects that did ship.
            It sharpened my instincts, my systems thinking, my product sense. It
            gave me the chance to redeem earlier design choices and think more
            holistically. It reminded me how to fight for the user — even when
            the outcome isn't guaranteed.
          </p>
          <p>And most importantly, it helped me grow.</p>
          <p>
            That growth doesn't go away just because the work didn't launch. I
            still carry it with me — in how I think, how I work, and how I
            approach every challenge that comes next.
