        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          High quality documentation is an important cornerstone of any software
          product, particularly if the product contains some complex workflows.
          Having easily accessible, well maintained and structured documentation
          provides some key benefits to a business, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Quicker onboarding for new users</li>
          <li>Easier learning curve</li>
          <li>Increased trust in the company</li>
          <li>Competitive advantage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Ultimately, if users feel confident that they can use a product, they
          are more likely to be advocates and it dramatically reduces support
          and training calls. That was the main objective we had when creating
          the itris Knowledgebase.
        </p>
        <p>
          I led the design and collaborated with key stakeholders from across
          the business to produce a high-quality learning resource for the
          company and the users of the product.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          At the time, documentation existed as PDFs on a shared drive. Users
          <i>did have access</i> to these documents, but you had to know where
          to look to find them. As a result, documents were often duplicated and
          changed to align more closely with the department consuming them,
          which led to scattered documentation that was quickly out of date.
        </p>
        <p>
          This gave rise to an increasing amount of inconsistency for users, as
          there was not an easily accessible, central source of truth for
          learning materials. Additionally, the training team was offering
          training courses, but these were big commitments from customers and
          proved to be inefficient for an industry that typically has a higher
          than average staff turnover.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was something that needed to be addressed as it was becoming an
          issue for the business and leading to users not getting the level of
          service they expected. It was also not meeting the standards of
          quality set by the business.
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <div class="goals">
          <div class="user-goals">
            <h3>User</h3>
            <ul>

              <li>
                Sign-posting in the product for features with more advanced
                concepts
              </li>
              <li>
                A collection of written and video materials so that users can
                learn at their own pace in their preferred method
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="business-goals">
            <h3>Business</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Remove friction with self-educating for users</li>
              <li>Increase user trust in the product and the company</li>
              <li>
                Single <em>source of truth</em> repository for documentation
              </li>
              <li>Lighten the burden on customer success and training teams</li>
              <li>Promote learning opportunities in the product</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          I looked into options of using an off-the-shelf solution to
          documentation and researched products like GitBook and Notion, but
          they lacked the customisation that we needed. Internally, we used
          Confluence, so I also looked into whether we could expose those
          articles publicly, but this came with too many trade-offs and again, a
          lack of customisation.
        </p>

        <h2>Opportunity</h2>
        <p>
          Since none of the off-the-shelf solutions were viable, I explored the
          idea of creating our own purpose-built site that catered for the
          different learning journeys for a user. Also, somewhere users could
          also find top tips, FAQs, and product release notes.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All the learning materials were currently in PDFs and our internal
            docs platform, so these would need to be ported over to the site
            (which was in Markdown format)
          </li>
          <li>
            A new iteration of our visual language was in progress, but it was
            immature so implementing this would add to the scope as new
            components would need to be created specifically for the
            Knowledgebase
          </li>
          <li>
            The training team would need to learn and become familiar with VS
            Code, writing articles in Markdown and have a good understanding of
            git
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          I spent some time exploring different designs until, together with key
          stakeholders, we settled on a final version. Throughout the design
          explorations, it was important to ensure that the design
          <em>felt right</em> and was aligned with the brand.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
          For inspiration, I looked at some best-in-class documentation and
          found myself drawn to Stripe Guides in particular. I also looked at
          Apple's support docs as well as Atlassian's documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final product contained a landing page, articles accessible
          through a series route (mirroring training courses) or categories
          route, search capabilities, release notes, top tips and FAQs.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Knowledgebase was a success and received positive feedback from
          users, internal teams, and even a competitor. Since its release in
          2022, there are 200+ articles on the site, as well as 50+ top tips and
          60+ FAQs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traffic to the Knowledgebase averages at around 1,600 visits per
          month, and the number of training and support enquiries has dropped
          significantly.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <i
            >"As a result of the Knowledgebase, the demands on our services
            changed and the volume of inbound calls and emails reduced
            considerably. We were also able to reduce the training department's
            headcount from 5 members of staff down to 1, whilst still
            maintaining strong customer feedback."</i
