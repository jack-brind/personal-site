                High quality documentation is an important cornerstone of any
                software product, particularly if the product contains some
                complex workflows. Having easily accessible, well maintained and
                structured documentation provides some key benefits to a
                business, including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Quicker onboarding for new users</li>
                <li>Easier learning curve</li>
                <li>Increased trust in the company</li>
                <li>Competitive advantage</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Ultimately, if users feel confident that they can use a product,
                they are more likely to be advocates and it dramatically reduces
                support and training calls. That was the main objective we had
                when creating the itris Knowledgebase.
              </p>
              <p>
                I led the design and collaborated with key stakeholders from
                across the business to produce a high-quality learning resource
                for the company and the users of the product.
              </p>

              <h2 id="tldr-problem">Problem</h2>
              <p>
                At the time, documentation existed as PDFs on a shared drive.
                Users
                <i>did have access</i> to these documents, but you had to know
                where to look to find them. As a result, documents were often
                duplicated and changed to align more closely with the department
                consuming them, which led to scattered documentation that was
                quickly out of date.
              </p>
              <p>
                This gave rise to an increasing amount of inconsistency for
                users, as there was not an easily accessible, central source of
                truth for learning materials. Additionally, the training team
                was offering training courses, but these were big commitments
                from customers and proved to be inefficient for an industry that
                typically has a higher than average staff turnover.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was something that needed to be addressed as it was
                becoming an issue for the business and leading to users not
                getting the level of service they expected. It was also not
                meeting the standards of quality set by the business.

                I looked into options of using an off-the-shelf solution to
                documentation and researched products like GitBook and Notion,
                but they lacked the customisation that we needed. Internally, we
                used Confluence, so I also looked into whether we could expose
                those articles publicly, but this came with too many trade-offs
                and again, a lack of customisation.
              </p>

              <h2 id="tldr-opportunity">Opportunity</h2>
              <p>
                Since none of the off-the-shelf solutions were viable, I
                explored the idea of creating our own purpose-built site that
                catered for the different learning journeys for a user. Also,
                somewhere users could also find top tips, FAQs, and product
                release notes.
              </p>

              <h2 id="tldr-challenges">Challenges</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  All the learning materials were currently in PDFs and our
                  internal docs platform, so these would need to be ported over
                  to the site (which was in Markdown format)
                </li>
                <li>
                  A new iteration of our visual language was in progress, but it
                  was immature so implementing this would add to the scope as
                  new components would need to be created specifically for the
                  Knowledgebase
                </li>
                <li>
                  The training team would need to learn and become familiar with
                  VS Code, writing articles in Markdown and have a good
                  understanding of git
                </li>

                I spent some time exploring different designs until, together
                with key stakeholders, we settled on a final version. Throughout
                the design explorations, it was important to ensure that the
                design
                <em>felt right</em> and was aligned with the brand.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
                For inspiration, I looked at some best-in-class documentation
                and found myself drawn to Stripe Guides in particular. I also
                looked at Apple's support docs as well as Atlassian's
                documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                The final product contained a landing page, articles accessible
                through a series route (mirroring training courses) or
                categories route, search capabilities, release notes, top tips
                and FAQs.

                The Knowledgebase was a success and received positive feedback
                from users, internal teams, and even a competitor. Since its
                release in 2022, there are 200+ articles on the site, as well as
                50+ top tips and 60+ FAQs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traffic to the Knowledgebase averages at around 1,600 visits per
                month, and the number of training and support enquiries has
                dropped significantly.

                  >As a result of the Knowledgebase, the demands on our services
                  changed and the volume of inbound calls and emails reduced
                  considerably. We were also able to reduce the training
                  department's headcount from 5 members of staff down to 1,
                  whilst still maintaining strong customer feedback.</i

              The UI in this case study represents the direction I was taking as
              part of a product redesign initiative. Although the project was
              later deprioritised and not released, this work is a more accurate
              reflection of my current design approach.<br /><br />If you're
