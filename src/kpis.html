                The recruitment industry is numbers-driven and KPIs play a
                critical role in measuring individual, team, and organisational
                performance. For recruiters, these metrics influence promotions,
                pay reviews, and commissions, making them a powerful motivator.
                For a business, these metrics indicate profitability and
                efficiency, among other things. By providing clarity and focus
                on targets, KPIs help individuals understand expectations,
                driving both personal and business success.

              <p>
                While some data <em>was</em> available in itris, it was
                scattered across different areas of the product, making it
                difficult to keep track of. There was also no way to record
                targets against any metrics, nor was there a dedicated space for
                users to monitor performance metrics efficiently. This oversight
                manifested in increased frustration and inefficiencies and as a
                result, users had to rely on workarounds, such as exporting
                multiple reports and manipulating them in spreadsheets, which
                was time-consuming and cumbersome.
              </p>
              <p>
                This inefficiency and lack of target options on metrics had a
                direct business impact, contributing to churn, lost deals, and
                ultimately an estimated
                <strong><i>£1.4m risk to annual revenue</i></strong

                We had a good amount of feedback on this problem already which
                came primarily from speaking to customers and other feedback
                streams, but also from the sales team. In addition, I analysed
                some competitors as well as similar stand-alone tools in the
                market.
              </p>
              <p>
                This provided a good amount of insight, but I had some knowledge
                gaps that I wanted to fill and assumptions to validate. So, I
                also conducted a survey to customers to dig a little deeper into
                some key themes identified initially. The results of the survey
                provided some clarity, including:

                      Historically, we understood KPIs to be
                      <i>target-based</i>, but I recognised an interesting
                      pattern in the survey, and I was keen to pull on the
                      thread. After following up with some respondents, my
                      suspicions were confirmed that some KPIs were set without
                      specific targets. This became a key insight, and one we
                      wouldn't have considered in the initial scope without
                      speaking to customers.

              <p>
                Once the research phase was complete, I collaborated with the
                development, product and QA teams to outline the initial scope
                for the project. The scope consisted of:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>a total of 25 configurable metrics to track</li>
                <li>granular configurability for nuanced metrics</li>
                <li>
                  historical tracking and auditing when targets are updated
                </li>
                <li>
                  a dashboard for users to keep track of their performance
                </li>
                <li>
                  drill down capabilities to dig deeper into the data behind the
                  KPIs
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                KPIs would be configurable in the settings area and would be
                tied to a user, team, or the whole organisation (i.e. all
                users).
              </p>

              </figure>
              <p>
                It was also crucial that KPIs were communicated to the user
                well. After many iterations of the KPI card, I settled on a
                final design that struck the right balance between information
                density and visual noise.

                The KPI cards were then displayed in a dedicated dashboard for
                the user so that they could have a single source of truth for
                their individual performance as well as their contributions to
                collective team and organisational metrics.

                Users can also drill down into the data behind the KPIs to see
                the activity that contributed to the metric. Users can export
                the data or convert it to a search.

                The feature shipped shortly before I left the company and so had
                not yet been available for long enough to generate measurable
                results. However, early internal feedback was very positive and
                as a result, the sales team felt more confident during customer
                demos, and stakeholders saw this as a key improvement given the
                potential revenue at risk. This work directly addressed known
                pain points and is expected to lead to more deal conversions and
                a lower risk to revenue.

                The UI in this case study represents the direction I was taking
                as part of a product redesign initiative. Although the project
                was later deprioritised and not released, this work is a more
                accurate reflection of my current design approach.<br /><br />
                This is a short project showcase and there were many challenges
                and edge cases that needed to be addressed. If you'd like to
