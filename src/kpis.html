              <p>
                The recruitment industry is numbers-driven and KPIs play a
                critical role in measuring individual, team, and organisational
                performance. For recruiters, these metrics influence promotions,
                pay reviews, and commissions, making them a powerful motivator.
                For a business, these metrics indicate profitability and
                efficiency, among other things. By providing clarity and focus
                on targets, KPIs help individuals understand expectations,
                driving both personal and business success.

              <p>
                While some data <em>was</em> available in itris, it was
                scattered across different areas of the product, making it
                difficult to keep track of. There was also no way to record
                targets against any metrics, nor was there a dedicated space for
                users to monitor performance metrics efficiently. This oversight
                manifested in increased frustration and inefficiencies and as a
                result, users had to rely on workarounds, such as exporting
                multiple reports and manipulating them in spreadsheets, which
                was time-consuming and cumbersome.
              </p>
              <p>
                This inefficiency and lack of target options on metrics had a
                direct business impact, contributing to churn, lost deals, and
                ultimately an estimated
                <strong><i>Â£1.4m risk to annual revenue</i></strong

                We had a good amount of feedback on this problem already which
                came primarily from speaking to customers and other feedback
                streams, but also from the sales team. In addition, I analysed
                some competitors as well as similar stand-alone tools in the
                market.
              </p>

                This provided a good amount of insight, but I had some knowledge
                gaps that I wanted to fill and assumptions to validate. So, I
                also conducted a survey to customers to dig a little deeper into
                some key themes identified initially. The results of the survey
                provided some clarity, including:

                      Historically, we understood KPIs to be
                      <i>target-based</i>, but I recognised an interesting
                      pattern in the survey, and I was keen to pull on the
                      thread. After following up with some respondents, my
                      suspicions were confirmed that some KPIs were set without
                      specific targets. This became a key insight, and one we
                      wouldn't have considered in the initial scope without
                      speaking to customers.

                Once the research phase was complete, I collaborated with the
                development, product and QA teams to outline the initial scope
                for the project. The scope consisted of:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>a total of 25 configurable metrics to track</li>
                <li>granular configurability for nuanced metrics</li>
                <li>
                  historical tracking and auditing when targets are updated
                </li>
                <li>
                  a dashboard for users to keep track of their performance
                </li>
                <li>
                  drill down capabilities to dig deeper into the data behind the
                  KPIs
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                KPIs would be configurable in the settings area and would be
                tied to a user, team, or the whole organisation (i.e. all
                users).
              </p>

              <p>
                It was also crucial that KPIs were communicated to the user
                well. After many iterations of the KPI card, I settled on a
                final design that struck the right balance between information
                density and visual noise.

              <p>
                The KPI cards were then displayed in a dedicated dashboard for
                the user so that they could have a single source of truth for
                their individual performance as well as their contributions to
                collective team and organisational metrics.

                While the full release is pending, the early feedback loop with
                sales demos and customer conversations confirmed strong
                alignment with market needs. Early indications gave key
                stakeholders confidence that the revenue gap can be narrowed.
                This work directly addressed known pain points and is expected
                to lead to more deal conversions and a lower risk to revenue.

                If managers and recruiters can easily set and track KPIs, they
                can drive individual performance, team success, and business

                used by hundreds of agencies, each with different team

              <h2 id="deep-dive-background">Background</h2>
              <p>
                itris is a Recruitment CRM used by staffing agencies to run
                their businesses. At its core, itris combines the functionality
                of a sales tool, Applicant Tracking System (ATS), and Customer
                Relationship Management (CRM) solution into one platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                Targets are commonplace in sales environments. The recruitment
                industry is numbers-driven and KPIs play a critical role in
                measuring individual, team, and organisational performance. For
                recruiters, these metrics influence promotions, pay reviews, and
                commissions, making them a powerful motivator. For a business,
                these metrics indicate profitability and efficiency, among other
                things. By providing clarity and focus on targets, KPIs help
                individuals understand expectations, driving both personal and
                business success.
              </p>

              <h2 id="deep-dive-problem">Problem</h2>
              <p>
                While itris had a robust and powerful reporting suite, users
                couldn't:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Set performance targets for individuals, teams or the company
                </li>
                <li>Track and measure those targets over time</li>
                <li>Visualise progress in one place</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Without this functionality, recruiters and managers were left
                exporting spreadsheets, building workarounds, or giving up
                entirely.
              </p>
              <p>
                Customers were increasingly frustrated, and the gap was hurting
                the business with an estimated
                <strong>Â£1.4 million in annual revenue at risk</strong> from
                churn and lost deals.

              </p>

              <h2 id="deep-dive-challenge">Challenge</h2>
              <p>
                The recruitment industry spans every type of work and every type
                of sector and our customer base reflected that. Some agencies
                specialised by industry, others by function, and some had unique
                team structures or workflows that needed to be catered for.
                Anything we designed needed to flex across all of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                From a KPIs point of view, we had to ask:
                <strong class="italic"
                  >What would be the most effective way to deliver a robust set
                  of functionality that is flexible enough to accommodate all of
                  the variations and use cases?</strong
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The data was already there. Our challenge was to transform it
                into something tangible that recruitment teams could use to
                understand their performance and their expectations.
              </p>

              <h2 id="deep-dive-discovery">Discovery</h2>
              <p>
                At the start of the project, I knew there would be a lot of
                unknowns. To deliver a good solution, I would need to spend more
                time researching, learning, and speaking with customers.
              </p>
              <p>I started by gathering everything we already knew:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Feedback from sales demos</li>
                <li>Feedback from customers</li>
                <li>
                  Competitive research into other CRMs and standalone KPI tools
                </li>
                <li>
                  Secondary research to understand common KPI tracking practices
                  used by sales teams across different industries
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Customer and prospect feedback was a major source of insight at
                itris, and we already had a good baseline of information to work
                from. However, I still had some unanswered questions. I didn't
                feel confident yet that we fully understood customer needs,
                particularly around nuances like team structures, target
                management, and reporting workflows.
              </p>
              <p>
                To deepen our understanding and validate assumptions, we decided
                to run a customer survey.
              </p>

              <h3 id="deep-dive-research">Survey</h3>
              <p>
                I worked closely with the Product Manager to build a survey that
                would help us better understand customer needs around KPIs and
                performance tracking. Our goals were to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Learn how customers are currently tracking KPIs</li>
                <li>Identify the most valuable metrics to include</li>
                <li>
                  Understand the most common configurations (individual vs
                  collective, reset intervals, review frequency)
                </li>
                <li>Gather insight on how KPI data would be used</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Key insights</h4>
              <p>The biggest takeaways we had were:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The importance of KPIs to customers was rated 8.74 out of 10
                </li>
                <li>
                  The importance of drill down into KPIs data was rated 9.17 out
                  of 10
                </li>
                <li>
                  Most of the respondents were using manual CSV exports to track
                  performance
                </li>
                <li>Many set collective team KPIs, not just individual ones</li>
                <li>
                  Weekly and monthly were the most common reset frequencies
                </li>
                <li>Targets were typically reviewed monthly or quarterly</li>
                <li>
                  Months and quarters were treated exclusively as
                  <i>calendar months</i>, not 30 or 90 days
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This feedback proved to be incredibly valuable and made me much
                more confident in an approach. However, there was interesting
                theme that emerged from survey that we hadn't previously
                considered. Historically, we understood KPIs to be intrinsically
                <emphasis>target-based</emphasis> where individual's or team's
                performance was based on targets to be hit. However, reading
                between the lines in some of the comments prompted me to follow
                up with some respondents to clarify some parts.
              </p>
              <p>
                A good number of the respondents explained that they treated KPI
                as much more of a business-level metric where they didn't
                necessarily need a target assigned, but wanted to see the
                performance on it's own to monitor activity rather than
                performance. This became a key insight, and one that, as a team,
                we wouldn't have considered in the initial scope without
                conducting the survey and following up with customers.

              <p>
                Armed with a better understanding of the customer need, I
                started exploring some solutions. The project was split up into
                2 main parts:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Configuration - The part that solves the directors and
                  managers needs
                </li>
                <li>Dashboards - The part that solved the user needs</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Configuring KPIs</h3>
              <p>
                The natural place to start was configuration. This was, however,
                undoubtedly the most tricky part of the project. For KPI
                configuration users initially needed to be able to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Select a metric to track (a total of 25 initial metrics were
                  agreed for the initial scope)
                </li>
                <li>Choose the reset interval (the duration)</li>
                <li>
                  Set the start and end dates of a KPI to track and audit
                  historical data
                </li>
                <li>Select affiliate users and/or teams</li>
                <li>
                  Set whether the KPI includes a target and, if it does,
                  configure the targets value
                </li>
              </ul>

                Initial model: User-owned KPIs
              </h3>

              <p>
                The most obvious and simplistic solution was assigning KPIs
                directly to users and teams in a user-owned model where each
                user or team would have their own unique KPI configurations. I
                explored this option, but this quickly proved to be inflexible
                and it wouldn't scale at all.

              <p>
                We knew from additional information gathered in the survey that
                KPIs weren't a one size fits all for some organisations,
                particularly for customers who had a much more nuanced approach
                that was based on seniority, experience, and expectations. For
                smaller companies, this might be manageable but if a 50-user
                agency needed 10 KPIs each, admins would be managing 500 unique
                KPIs with updates required every month or quarter. For larger
                organisations, this manual overhead was a non-starter. We needed
                a better model.
              </p>
              <h2 id="deep-dive-pivot">A pivot: Centralised KPIs</h2>
              <p>
                After several iterations and getting nowhere, I proposed
                flipping the model.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of assigning individual KPIs to each user, was there a
                way we could treat a KPI as a source of truth and simply assign
                users to it? We knew that users might share the same KPI
                template, albeit the target might be slightly different. This
                alternative approach brought major benefits:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>A single source of truth for configuration</li>
                <li>
                  Changes would cascade to all users unless explicitly
                  overridden
                </li>
                <li>Supported both individual and collective targets</li>
                <li>Reduced manual work for admins</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                After some initial ideas in Figma, it became apparent that the
                trickiest part of this model would be gracefully handling
                multiple users or teams in the same KPI configuration, with the
                potential of having different targets.

                After a number of rounds of iterations, collaborating with the
                product team, an engineer and the sales director, we had a much
                better idea of what a KPI configuration looked like.
              </p>
              <p>Each KPI would include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Metric:</strong> What are we tracking? (e.g. Jobs
                  obtained)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Name:</strong> An option for customers to use their
                  own terminology (e.g. Inbound Vacancies)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Description:</strong> An optional text box for
                  customers to inform users on how that can contribute to this
                  KPI
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Filters:</strong> Additional filters depending on the
                  metric (some metrics required more granularity than others)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reset Interval:</strong> How often did the target
                  reset? Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually. This
                  also included options for rolling weeks, months, quarters and
                  years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Effective Dates:</strong> Window for the KPI to be
                  relevant (essential for accurate historical KPI data audits
                  and updates)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Target:</strong> Optional target that supports
                  numeric, monetary or percentage values
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Target Type:</strong> Set whether the KPI targets
                  individuals or a collection of users / teams
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Assigned Users / Teams:</strong> Who is assigned to
                  this KPI?

              </ul>
              <p>
                This model allowed for more nuanced setup including tailoring
                targets to individuals and adding or removing users or teams
                from a target easily.

              <h4>Reset component</h4>
              <p>
                The reset component needed to cater for lots of different
                configurations. I designed a flexible component that would allow
                this nuance.

                />

                <figcaption>The reset component</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <h4>Collective KPIs</h4>
              <p>
                We initially assumed collective KPIs would be important, and the
                survey confirmed it. Nearly half of respondents advocated for a
                collective option, so we made it a core part of the design.
              </p>
              <p>
                By selecting Collective as the target type, the target was
                attributed to a group of users / teams, rather than individuals.
                For example, a group of five recruiters might have a quarterly
                target of 150 new jobs obtained. This balanced over and
                under-performers within the group and had a successful outcome
                when the combined total hits the target.
              </p>
              <h4>Default target inheritance</h4>
              <p>
                When setting individual targets, users could set a default value
                at the KPI level. This default was immediately inherited by any
                user or team assigned to the KPI, making KPI management much
                more scalable.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, we needed a way for users to optionally set custom
                target values at the individual level. To achieve this, we used
                an input that displayed the inherited default target as a
                placeholder. This allowed users to enter a custom value if
                needed. When a custom value was entered, a reset button appeared
                next to the field, enabling users to easily revert back to the
                default.
              </p>
              <p>
                This wasn't the best solution. The placeholder styling made the
                field appear disabled, and the lack of strong affordance could
                cause confusion. We consciously accepted this trade-off due to
                project timelines with a plan to gather user feedback and refine
                it in future iterations.

              <h2 id="deep-dive-widgets">Widgets</h2>
              <p>
                Once the configuration was complete, I moved onto the KPI
                dashboard. This dashboard needed to provide a simple and
                effective way for users to understand everything they needed to
                know about where they were with their performance at the current
                point in time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The layout scaffold of the dashboard was a common pattern that
                we already used for business intelligence dashboards so the
                widgets were the main point of focus in this stage of the
                design.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong
                  >The main challenge here was balancing information density and
                  visual clarity.</strong
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                It was important to make key details immediately obvious without
                creating visual clutter. With the constraint of the appropriate
                widget size and the amount of potential information, this was a
                tough task.
              </p>
              <p>
                In some cases, users could see over 20 widgets in this dashboard
                so I need to ensure that the widgets showed enough information
                to inform the user without overwhelming them.

                the widgets. However, as we developed the concept further, we
                realised these additions complicated the design and added more
                complexity to an already significant project. To maintain a
                clean, usable interface and keep the initial release focused, we
                made the decision to de-prioritise these features. This allowed
                us to reduce visual noise and deliver a clearer, more
                streamlined user experience, while keeping the door open to
                introducing these ideas in future iterations.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a number of discussions with engineers and the product
                team, we settled on a much more simple design. The final widget
                had:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The heading section is clear and shows enough primary
                  information for the KPI
                </li>
                <li>
                  Secondary information like description is available through
                  clearly sign-posted hint in the hover state (not all KPIs had
                  hints, so this made the IA more consistent and predictable).
                </li>
                <li>
                  A button for drilling down into the data behind the KPI (when
                  hovering)
                </li>
                <li>
                  A coloured indicator to clearly represent collective KPIs
                </li>
                <li>
                  A minimal donut or gauge chart depending on whether the value
                  was a percentage or not
                </li>
                <li>Clear statistical data preseted to the user</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The result was a clean, breathable KPI widget layout that, when
                replicated across an entire dashboard, had a good visual balance
                and hierarchy.

              <p>
                Drilling down was also available through a side panel that
                overlayed the dashboard. The most important parts here was being
                able to export or convert to a search. Converting to a search
                was a powerful option because it would allow further
                manipulation to drill into the data even further.

              <h2 id="deep-dive-outcome">Outcome</h2>

              <p>
                While the full release is pending, the early feedback loop with
                sales demos and customer conversations confirmed strong
                alignment with market needs. Early indications gave key
                stakeholders confidence that the revenue gap can be narrowed.
                This work directly addressed known pain points and is expected
                to lead to more deal conversions and a lower risk to revenue.
              </p>

              <h2 id="deep-dive-reflections">Reflections</h2>
              <h3>Navigating competing priorities</h3>
              <p>
                At the time this project was being worked on, the business was
                in the middle of being acquired. This created competing demands
                for attention and resource and so ruthless prioritisation and
                scope management were essential to keeping up momentum.
              </p>
              <h3>Designing for flexibility</h3>
              <p>
                When adding flexibility to a product, it inherently comes with
                the risk of decreased usability. Every layer of complexity
                introduced the risk of confusion for users. We had to ensure
                that there were sensible defaults, learning resources signposted
                in key areas and guardrails to stop users from getting lost in
                the configuration.
              </p>
              <p>
                After collaborating with the Training Manager on some details,
                she suggested that we should include a set of default,
                targetless KPIs as part of the release in order to aid learning.
                This was a great idea and subsequently added as a separate
                project.
              </p>
              <h3>The benefits of research</h3>
              <p>
                We initially assumed KPIs were purely target-driven. Qualitative
                follow-ups proved that many customers prioritised visibility
                over targets. This insight fundamentally shifted our approach
                and made the final design far more aligned with customer needs.
              </p>
              <h3>Future opportunities</h3>
              <p>Given more time, I would have loved to explore:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>AI-driven projections and recommendations</li>
                <li>Support for historical comparisons and trends over time</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I believe both would further enhance the platform's value to
                recruitment teams
              </p>
