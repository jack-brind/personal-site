        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          The recruitment industry is numbers-driven and KPIs play a critical
          role in measuring individual, team, and organisational performance.
          For recruiters, these metrics influence promotions, pay reviews, and
          commissions, making them a powerful motivator. For a business, these
          metrics indicate profitability and efficiency, among other things. By
          providing clarity and focus on targets, KPIs help individuals
          understand expectations, driving both personal and business success.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          While some data <em>was</em> available in itris, it was scattered
          across different areas of the product, making it difficult to keep
          track of. There was also no way to record targets against any metrics,
          nor was there a dedicated space for users to monitor performance
          metrics efficiently. This oversight manifested in increased
          frustration and inefficiencies and as a result, users had to rely on
          workarounds, such as exporting multiple reports and manipulating them
          in spreadsheets, which was time-consuming and cumbersome.
        </p>
        <p>
          This inefficiency and lack of target options on metrics had a direct
          business impact, contributing to churn, lost deals, and ultimately an
          estimated <strong><i>Â£1.4m risk to annual revenue</i></strong
          >.
        </p>

        <div class="goals">

            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          We had a good amount of feedback on this problem already which came
          primarily from speaking to customers and other feedback streams, but
          also from the sales team. In addition, I analysed some competitors as
          well as similar stand-alone tools in the market.
        </p>
        <p>
          This provided a good amount of insight, but I had some knowledge gaps
          that I wanted to fill and assumptions to validate. So, I also
          conducted a survey to customers to dig a little deeper into some key
          themes identified initially. The results of the survey provided some
          clarity, including:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 6px">
          <li>
            Nearly a third of respondents set collective KPIs for groups of
            users as opposed to individual users
          </li>
          <li>
            Weekly KPIs were the most popular, with monthly KPIs a close second
          </li>
          <li>
            The importance of being able to drill down into the KPI data was
            rated 92%
          </li>
          <li>
            Most respondents were exporting reports to Excel to track KPIs
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="banner">
          <div class="banner-icon insight-icon">ðŸ’¡</div>
          <div class="banner-content">
            <div class="banner-header">Key insight</div>
            <div class="banner-text">
              <p>
                Historically, we understood KPIs to be <i>target-based</i>, but
                I recognised an interesting pattern in the survey, and I was
                keen to pull on the thread. After following up with some
                respondents, my suspicions were confirmed that some KPIs were
                set without specific targets. This became a key insight, and one
                we wouldn't have considered in the initial scope without
                speaking to customers.

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Once the research phase was complete, I collaborated with the
          development, product and QA teams to outline the initial scope for the
          project. The scope consisted of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a total of 25 configurable metrics to track</li>
          <li>granular configurability for nuanced metrics</li>
          <li>historical tracking and auditing when targets are updated</li>
          <li>a dashboard for users to keep track of their performance</li>
          <li>
            drill down capabilities to dig deeper into the data behind the KPIs
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          KPIs would be configurable in the settings area and would be tied to a
          user, team, or the whole organisation (i.e. all users).
        </p>

        <figure class="article-content__figure">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/configuration.png"
            alt="Settings area where KPIs are configured and managed"
            class="article-content__image--app lightbox-image"
          />
          <figcaption>Table view of configured KPIs</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="article-content__figure">

            alt="Image of a modal for creating new KPIs"
            class="article-content__image--app sunken-image__new-kpi"
          />
          <figcaption>Modal to create a new KPI</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          It was also crucial that KPIs were communicated to the user well.
          After many iterations of the KPI card, I settled on a final design
          that struck the right balance between information density and visual
          noise.
        </p>

        <figure class="article-content__figure">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/kpi-anatomy.png"
            alt="KPI widget card anatomy"
            class="article-content__image sunken-image"
          />
          <figcaption>KPI widget card anatomy in hover state</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The KPI cards were then displayed in a dedicated dashboard for the
          user so that they could have a single source of truth for their
          individual performance as well as their contributions to collective
          team and organisational metrics.
        </p>

        <figure class="article-content__figure">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/dashboard.png"
            alt="KPI dashboard"
            class="article-content__image lightbox-image"
          />
          <figcaption>Final dashboard design to visualise KPIs</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Users can also drill down into the data behind the KPIs to see the
          activity that contributed to the metric. Users can export the data or
          convert it to a search.
        </p>

          />

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          The feature shipped shortly before I left the company and so had not
          yet been available for long enough to generate measurable results.
          However, early internal feedback was very positive and as a result,
          the sales team felt more confident during customer demos, and
          stakeholders saw this as a key improvement given the potential revenue
          at risk. This work directly addressed known pain points and is
          expected to lead to more deal conversions and a lower risk to revenue.
