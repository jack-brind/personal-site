            <p>
              If you're a Product Designer, you've likely experienced a time
              when you've been deep in a design, attempting to pull off a
              <i>clever solution</i> only to be met with more and more
              complexity around every corner. You’re bogged down in details that
              shouldn’t have been there in the first place. You’re playing
              whack-a-mole with edge cases and firefighting complications of
              your own making. The further you go, the more you lose sight of
              the real goal.
            </p>
            <p>I’ve been there more times than I care to admit.</p>
            <p>
              What starts as an attempt to make the best solution possible, ends
              in something hard to make sense of — for you, as well as your
              users.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a temptation to over-index on the
              <i>clever solution</i> with the idea that if we handle all the
              edge cases for users and plumb in intricate logic, we’ll end up
              with a more “complete” experience. But the truth is, too often a
              solution becomes more complicated than it needs to be.
              Fortunately, we can draw upon a tool that can help to correct the
              path.
            </p>
            <h2>Enter: Occam's Razor</h2>
            <p>
              I first encountered Occam's Razor during a Critical Thinking
              module in my Philosophy degree. It is a principle popularised by
              William of Ockham, a 14th-century English Franciscan friar who
              argued:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="italic">
                Plurality should not be posited without necessity.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              But what does that mean? At its core, Occam's Razor is a
              problem-solving heuristic. Modern interpretations of this
              translate as simply
              <i>Don’t make things more complicated than they need to be.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s a mental model that helps reframe complexity into its
              simplest useful form.
            </p>
            <h2>The problem with simplicity</h2>
            <p>
              It’s tempting to reduce this principle to “make things simpler”
              but that misses the point. Simplicity isn’t the absence of
              complexity, it’s the absence of <i>unnecessary</i> complexity. It
              is more a way of finding simplicity <i>within</i> complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, Occam's Razor isn't a magic wand that you can shake
              at your Figma file to make it all better. In reality, finding the
              right balance between too simple and overly complex is a
              tightrope. Knowing when, and how, to cut out unnecessary
              complexity comes with experience and even then, the most seasoned
              designers will still occasionally pursue the perfect solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Simplicity holds almost <i>Holy Grail</i> status in design, and it
              makes sense:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="italic">
                A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s
                not that good.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Because of this, some products or experiences are full of UI
              tricks like hidden gestures, or long-press to reveal overflow
              menus, for example. These types of patterns can introduce a lack
              of discoverability. It might reduce <i>visual</i> complexity but
              at the cost of clarity. Similarly, in an effort to simplify, we
              might encapsulate heavy, complex operations behind a single
              button. However, this can have drawbacks: if a user clicks a
              button and doesn’t know exactly what it’ll do, it can erode
              confidence and trust.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some product experiences are inescapably complex. The job isn’t to
              pretend those complexities don’t exist but to handle them
              responsibly. Simplicity doesn’t mean stripping things bare or
              rejecting complexity entirely. It means avoiding unnecessary
              complexity. A product should be no more and no less than what’s
              needed to solve the problem effectively.
            </p>
            <h2>A practical example</h2>
            <p>
              At itris, I had worked on a design for a modal and posted it in a
              chat with the product team for feedback.
            </p>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
              <img
                src="/assets/images/modal.png"
                alt="Screenshot of a modal to edit groups"
                style="width: 60%; margin: 40px auto"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              A junior designer that I was mentoring made a comment on the Save
              button saying:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p class="italic">
                Just to check… this button will be disabled until the user makes
                a change, right?
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              He later referenced Don Norman’s first usability heuristic,
              <i>visibility of system status</i> — if there’s nothing to save,
              logically the users shouldn't be able to save. It was a fair
              point. Disabling the button would offer feedback on the form's
              current state.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, disabling would add unnecessary complexity. We would have
              to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Track whether the user has made any changes</li>
              <li>Compare the current form state to the original</li>
              <li>
                Handle edge cases like:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    What if they changed the icon colour or radar type and then
                    changed it back?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    What if they typed some whitespace into the name or
                    description fields?
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              All that effort to make the button logic water-tight to prevent…
              what, exactly?
            </p>
            <p>
              Saving a form that hasn’t changed is harmless. Borrowing a
              programming principle, it is <i>idempotent</i> meaning that you
              can do it repeatedly without changing the result. So why block the
              user from doing it?
            </p>
            <p>
              Some might argue that disabling the button is a best practice, but
              best practices are starting points, not hard rules, and they
              aren’t always the best fit. The trade-off here is that the UX
              <i>technically</i> goes against best practice, but leaving the
              button enabled works just fine and no extra logic is necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes the simplest, most obvious solution is also the best
              one. It's not about being rigid with best practices, it's about
              making thoughtful trade-offs.
            </p>
            <h2>Choosing what matters</h2>
            <p>
              Occam’s Razor is a powerful principle that can guide clearer,
              simpler decisions when things start to get bloated or
              overcomplicated. It encourages us to ask critical questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Is this a real user need or an internal bias?</li>
              <li>Are we overvaluing edge cases?</li>
              <li>
                Are we adding logic that benefits the user, or just adding
                logic?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This principle has repeatedly helped me step back, rethink a
              direction, and cut through the noise. Not by focusing on
              minimalism, but by focusing on what’s essential.
