        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          Temporary and contract staffing businesses have a duty of care to
          their clients to ensure that the workers that they place are fully
          compliant. This includes such things as background checks,
          certificates and qualifications, and rights to work, and the
          requirements can vary between sectors dramatically. In itris, there
          are two modes for compliance — <i>Informational</i> or
          <i>Preventative</i>, and there became a need to introduce the ability
          for users to override preventative compliance requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          I collaborated with the product and development teams to reach an
          elegant solution.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          There is no middle ground for compliance in itris, and that was
          intentional — it either stops a user from placing or extending a
          non-compliant candidate, or it is allowed, and the compliance status
          is highlighted to the user. However, some customers wanted to confirm
          placements far in advance, where compliance requirements wouldn't be
          satisfied initially, but would be in place before the start date.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was particularly the case with the education sector, where
          teachers were placed at schools for the following school year far in
          advance of the start date. Customers still wanted compliance to be
          preventative, but needed to be able to create placement records to be
          able to invoice their clients and in its current state, this was
          causing customers to use inefficient workarounds.
        </p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          After collating feedback from customers, I noticed 3 categories of
          requests:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A manager typing a password in at their computer — This is prone to
            exploitation and doesn't scale effectively for hybrid or remote
            teams.
          </li>
          <li>
            A hybrid between preventative and information compliance — Given the
            sensitive, business critical nature of compliance, we intentionally
            wanted the options to be strictly on or off, and we didn't want to
            blur the lines.
          </li>
          <li>
            Draft placements — We had considered this as part of a wider
            initiative, but this would have significantly increased the scope of
            the project, which we didn't have the appetite for at the time.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These categories addressed specific customers' needs, but we needed to
          keep the broader customer-base in mind. However, the idea of a
          password entered to override compliance was a thread I wanted to pull
          on a little more.
        </p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          The trouble with a password is that if a user sees that password as
          someone is typing it in, they can use it again and again with no
          ramifications. But it got me thinking about a common pattern seen in
          modern software, which is 2-Factor Authentication. What if we could
          use something along the lines of a one time passcode to safely allow
          compliance requirements to be overridden?
        </p>
        <p>
          After meetings with the product team and developers, we decided on a
          direction and implemented a method for privileged users to generate
          unique, time-based codes to override compliance restrictions. This
          also included an audit trail of when compliance was overridden and who
          the code was issued by.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          Crucially, overriding compliance did not mean that the candidate was
          marked as compliant; they were still non-compliant and would still be
          highlighted in compliance reports. However, users were unblocked and
          the placement could be created.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 32px">Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          Within a month of this improvement being released, one customer on an
          older version upgraded with a contractual value of over £150k. They
          were initially not prepared to upgrade without this feature. We were
          also confident that the outcome of this project would improve customer
          retention and cover the potential loss of revenue.
