              <p>
                Temporary and contract staffing businesses have a duty of care
                to their clients to ensure that the workers that they place are
                fully compliant. This includes such things as background checks,
                certificates and qualifications, and rights to work, and the
                requirements can vary between sectors dramatically. In itris,
                there are two modes for compliance — <i>Informational</i> or
                <i>Preventative</i>, and there became a need to introduce the
                ability for users to override preventative compliance
                requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                I collaborated with the product and development teams to reach
                an elegant solution.
              </p>
              <img

                alt="Overrides hero image"
                class="article__hero-image--override skew-reverse"
              />
              <h2 id="tldr-problem">Problem</h2>
              <p>
                There is no middle ground for compliance in itris, and that was
                intentional — it either stops a user from placing or extending a
                non-compliant candidate, or it is allowed, and the compliance
                status is highlighted to the user. However, some customers
                wanted to confirm placements far in advance, where compliance
                requirements wouldn't be satisfied initially, but would be in
                place before the start date.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was particularly the case with the education sector, where
                teachers were placed at schools for the following school year
                far in advance of the start date. Customers still wanted
                compliance to be preventative, but needed to be able to create
                placement records to be able to invoice their clients and in its
                current state, this was causing customers to use inefficient
                workarounds.

              <p>
                After collating feedback from customers, I noticed 3 categories
                of requests:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  A manager typing a password in at their computer — This is
                  prone to exploitation and doesn't scale effectively for hybrid
                  or remote teams.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A hybrid between preventative and information compliance —
                  Given the sensitive, business critical nature of compliance,
                  we intentionally wanted the options to be strictly on or off,
                  and we didn't want to blur the lines.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Draft placements — We had considered this as part of a wider
                  initiative, but this would have significantly increased the
                  scope of the project, which we didn't have the appetite for at
                  the time.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                These categories addressed specific customers' needs, but we
                needed to keep the broader customer-base in mind. However, the
                idea of a password entered to override compliance was a thread I
                wanted to pull on a little more.
              </p>

              <h2 id="tldr-solution">Solution</h2>
              <p>
                The trouble with a password is that if a user sees that password
                as someone is typing it in, they can use it again and again with
                no ramifications. But it got me thinking about a common pattern
                seen in modern software, which is 2-Factor Authentication. What
                if we could use something along the lines of a one time passcode
                to safely allow compliance requirements to be overridden?
              </p>
              <p>
                After meetings with the product team and developers, we decided
                on a direction and implemented a method for privileged users to
                generate unique, time-based codes to override compliance
                restrictions. This also included an audit trail of when
                compliance was overridden and who the code was issued by.
              </p>

              <p>
                Crucially, overriding compliance did not mean that the candidate
                was marked as compliant; they were still non-compliant and would
                still be highlighted in compliance reports. However, users were
                unblocked and the placement could be created.

              <p>
                Within a month of this improvement being released, one customer
                on an older version upgraded with a contractual value of over
                £150k. They were initially not prepared to upgrade without this
                feature. We were also confident that the outcome of this project
                would improve customer retention and cover the potential loss of
                revenue.
