              <h2>TL;DR</h2>
              <p>
                Most design case studies are polished success stories. This
                isn't one of them. It's about an 18-month redesign of itris, a
                recruitment CRM I worked on — a project I poured everything
                into, only for it to be cancelled before launch. But this story
                isn't about the product that shipped. It's about growth,
                hindsight, and the lessons I learned along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                I fell into design unexpectedly after joining the company as a
                documentation writer straight out of university. By questioning
                inconsistencies in the product — like a button that literally
                did nothing — I was gradually invited to suggest improvements.
                That curiosity grew into a career. Eventually, I became the
                company's first product designer and was tasked with redesigning
                their ageing desktop CRM product, which we rebuilt and released
                in 2020.
              </p>
              <p>
                That launch should have been a proud moment, but I felt uneasy.
                My skills had evolved faster than the product had. The UI no
                longer reflected my design sensibilities, and we'd built it on a
                tech stack (WPF) that was already starting to creak under modern
                expectations. Despite the positive feedback, I knew we could do
                better — and I wanted another shot at it.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2023, I got that chance. The company greenlit a web-based
                version, and I saw it as a fresh start. This wasn't just a port
                — it was an opportunity to rethink everything: the architecture,
                the interactions, the experience. I brought a decade of hard-won
                lessons, helped choose Vue.js and Storybook, and began laying
                the foundation for a scalable, modern design system with a small
                cross-functional team.
              </p>
              <p>
                This series documents that journey — not just the pixels and
                patterns, but the thinking behind them. It's not a conventional
                case study, because it wasn't a conventional project. It's a
                reflection on what it means to let go, to evolve, and to design
                not just a better product, but a better version of yourself.

              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                In my previous article, I outlined the need for a redesign of
                itris. This article follows more of a case study like structure,
                but it's still not your traditional cookie cutter case study -
                sorry to disappoint. It does, however, cover the strategy and
                thought process behind tearing down the house and rebuilding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like a building, a product needs to have rock solid foundations
                to support something that will in place for a long time. A
                product's usability is directly tied to the IA and navigation so
                getting this right was paramount. Starting with the IA is like
                creating the container to hold the rest of the redesigned views,
                so starting here made sense.
              </p>
            </section>
            <section class="article-content">
              <h2>Auditing the current IA</h2>
              <p>
                I'd love to share a nice clean process here but to tell you the
                truth, due to it being a side project for much of the time
                because of other priorities, the process was messy and
                scattered. I'd have the odd spurt of focus on it and then have
                to drop it again so momentum was hard to keep up. Therefore, the
                process wasn't linear at all.
              </p>
              <p>
                At first, looking at what the redesign could be, it was tempting
                to jump straight in and tackle the key parts, but it was
                important to maintain a level of focus and the chrome was
                arguably the part of the itris 9 that needed the most attention.
                And I loved it. I really enjoy fiddling with the details on core
                functional components so it was good fun working on this. I
                enjoy these types of challenges.
              </p>
              <p>This is what the itris 9 chrome looked like:</p>

              <p>
                I could list more issues than there are pixels in this screen.
                The key ones are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Colour is not timeless</li>
                <li>
                  The action bar blue has a poor contrast ratio with the white
                  foregrounds of 3.32:1
                </li>
                <li>
                  The nav bar at the top has a load of icons without labels
                  (even internally this was becoming a problem!)
                </li>
                <li>
                  The sidebar sub-menu was the same for all main records and a
                  bit redundant
                </li>
                <li>
                  The sidebar sub-menu interaction of opening and closing was
                  clunky
                </li>
                <li>
                  The action bar was directly related to the loaded view but
                  there was a disconnect
                </li>
                <li>
                  The admin bar was in the same hierarchical level as the action
                  buttons for the loaded view
                </li>
                <li>The admin bar didn't have labels</li>
                <li>
                  The nav bar and action bar took up far too much vertical real
                  estate
                </li>
                <li>
                  The status bar was unnecessary most of the time and could
                  easily be moved
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>There's plenty more that I won't bore you with.</p>

              <h2>Process</h2>
              <p>
                Narrative - needed to break everything out (37 things) then
                piece it all back together in a better way. Dismantling an
                existing product to piece the puzzle back together again in a
                better way. Any analogies here? Homeland - Carrie with a pin
                board. The process was pretty simple. Break it and put it back
                together in a better way. But that isn't so easy:
              </p>
              <figure class="article-content__figure">
                <img
                  src="/assets/images/Pepe_Silvia.jpg"
                  alt="Chrome"
                  style="border-radius: 8px"
                />
                <figcaption>Caption</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>
                I needed to break these things out into their own separate
                pieces. First, I ignored the action bar - these were directly
                related to records and had absolutely no right to be part of the
                IA and chrome.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I was left with was the nav bar buttons, the quick find,
                the sidebar menu and admin panel. So I noted down each piece
                that I needed to find a new home for - a total of 37 items.
              </p>
              <figure class="article-content__figure">
                <img src="/assets/images/items.png" alt="Chrome" />
                <figcaption>Caption</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>
                At this point, I needed to work out how to group these items
                logically. It didn't make sense to have these as one long list
                because it would lack any sort of hierarchy and look too
                cluttered and lead to sidebar overload.
              </p>
              <p>
                From customer feedback, we knew that some customers wanted to be
                able to customise their workflows. For example, for a recruiter,
                areas like timesheets and financial exports weren't important.
                Likewise, for compliance officers, they only really needed
                access to compliance areas and not really anything related to
                recruiter workflows. Financial people only really needed access
                to jobs and placements and candidate records. So we knew we
                wanted to make it customisable.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I grouped all the items in logical groupings. At this point,
                the groupings weren't perfect, but they gave me at least some
                semblance of order.
              </p>
              <figure class="article-content__figure">
                <img src="/assets/images/items-sorted.png" alt="Chrome" />
                <figcaption>Grouped logically</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>
                I then looked at some products that I use regularly and other
                popular products to get some inspiration for the IA. Almost all
                of the products that I use had just a single a sidebar. I also
                looked at different design systems and some popular Figma UI
                libraries like Untitled UI, for example.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inspiration was drawn from MacOS, Linear, Campsite, Notion,
                Confluence, YouTube, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                From then, I had a good idea of how I wanted to proceed. So I
                started looking at options. One of the key things that I wanted
                to change was the dark blue background for the chrome. It was
                called Midnight Blue and it was the base colour for itris 9, but
                it looked old very quickly. For a product to be timeless, or at
                least look fresher for longer, neutral colours is what I was
                aiming to use. For the new product, I also wanted to have a dark
                mode (this was asked for countless times, but there was too much
                design and technical debt to get it working in itris 9).
              </p>
              <p>
                Another thing I wanted to add to the sidebar was a nice
                productivity section that allowed you to pin records, views and
                areas to the sidebar in a section that would come to be known as
                Shortcuts. For now, however, this was sidelined until I had the
                rest of the sidebar figured out.
              </p>
              <p>
                So I started to put together some ideas for a sidebar - this is
                just a selection of some of the designs I worked through and I
                didn't love any of them. I did quite like the style of number 3
                with the blue accent and elevated white button with legs coming
                out but something about it just didn't really sit well with me.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other thing I needed to consider was how the items in the
                sidebar would be customised and none of these worked very nicely
                with that. I experimented with the idea of having a curated list
                at the top and a section for all items at the bottom where you
                could pin and unpin to the curated list but this didn't feel
                right either.
              </p>

                Eventually, after lot of playing around, things started to fall
                into place, but there were some things I needed to work out
                first.
              </p>
              <h2>Submenu</h2>
              <p>
                In the itris 9 sidebar, the main records (applicant, company,
                contact, job and placement records) had sub-menus when you
                clicked on them.
              </p>
              <figure class="article-content__figure">
                <img
                  src="/assets/images/submenu.png"
                  alt="Chrome"
                  style="width: 180px"
                />
                <figcaption>
                  Some later concepts of the sidebar as it was coming together.
                </figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>
                Clicking on the main header menu item would expand and collapse
                the menu, but it also opened the associated Record Hub which is
                a sort of dashboard for the record where you can your recently
                opened records, favourites, recently created, and some more. So
                this menu had 2 contexts:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Opened the hub</li>
                <li>Opened / closed the sub-menu</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                This is a bit awkward with 2 behaviours so I wanted to fix this.
                In each sub menu, we had the same 3 buttons - New, Search and
                Group. New would obviously open the new record form which made
                sense. But search and group would just open the record search
                and record groups areas with the record type pre-selected. So
                for example, if you clicked Groups under Companies, it would
                open the Groups area with Companies pre-selected.
              </p>
              <p>
                The interaction the sub menu wasn't smooth either. The
                interaction was janky and it would move the menu around which
                didn't feel nice either. So I explored what we could do to make
                this better in the new version.
              </p>

                Sidenote: One of my UX pet hates is where a loaded view
                refreshes after a period of time and you select an option that
                changes 0.132ms before you click it and you click the wrong
                thing. This happens on the Siri suggestions list on iOS and it
                boils my piss.

              <p>
                The main problem with the interaction was that the sub-menus
                were mutually exclusive so you couldn't have both open at the
                same time, nor was there any signifier on the menu to afford
                opening or any way to stop this behaviour.
              </p>
              <p>
                The group and search buttons were redundant as they were just
                nice workflow enhancements that didn't have that much of an
                impact. Removing these was a happy tradeoff. So that left me
                with creating new records. In itris 9, this was the primary
                workflow for creating new records so I wanted to preserve this
                paradigm to make the transition a painless as possible for users
                that had already built up that mental model.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had previously explored the idea of having a curated list of
                pinned menu items and another section for all tools that and
                users would be able to move menu items between those lists by
                pinning and unpinning. The pin button would be in the right side
                of the menu. However, late explorations led me away from that
                route but I still liked the idea of having an action on the menu
                item. So I settled on having a new button on each menu items
                where a new instance of something could be created and this
                would be shown on hover. This kept context nicely.

                After that I needed to work out how customisation would work.
                Bit first, I needed to finalise the groupings.
              </p>
              <h2>Groupings</h2>
              <p>
                We then ranked them high to low priority (based on user's
                interactions with them). With a total of 37 pieces of the
                puzzle, I couldn't put all of them in the menu. Some that were
                infrequently used needed to go elsewhere. These were like the
                secondary navigations that were needed now and again and so
                didn't belong in the main groupings. What I ended up with was
                this:
              </p>

              </figure>
              <p>
                The orange items would be in dropdown menus and the purple would
                all be accessible from the main sidebar menu. But the purple
                items would form the primary navigation options.
              </p>
              <h2>Menu customisation</h2>
              <p>
                With 18 possible menu items, we needed a way of being able to
                curate the most important ones for a user. I had worked out the
                menu item component:
              </p>

              <p>
                Next steps - work out sidebar width and collapsing behaviour,
                how would you customise, shortcuts? What is fixed in workspace?
                Etc
