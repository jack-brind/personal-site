            <h2 id="tldr-problem">Learning code is hard</h2>
            <p>At the end of 2024, I decided to start learning JavaScript.</p>
            <p>
              As a product designer, I wanted to be more effective at
              communicating with engineers and actually build a few side project
              ideas myself. I was already proficient with HTML and CSS, but I
              wanted my prototypes to come to life and to do that I would need
              to be able to write JavaScript and, eventually, React code.
            </p>
            <p>
              I consider myself to be quite a fast learner, but I was under no
              illusion that it would be easy. I knew the learning curve would be
              steep, but after learning the fundamentals early on like
              variables, conditionals, and operators, I felt confident. I had
              signed up for Jonas Schmedtmann's
              <a
                href="https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wfe3@r4EkOsfS64doh_MjK1dAV6IlUlc78O50WbdB9F3U3W10qmjsNWkYE23tpm9PsvceyA==/"
                target="_blank"
                >JavaScript course</a
              >
              on Udemy and, more recently, his
              <a
                href="https://www.udemy.com/share/108PTo3@3gcr6pB7VoZbRihi679sQ14MarCPOWDA5S2UBKDeDwihr44Y5HD3qqfoNpYpVfjtwg==/"
                target="_blank"
                >React course</a
              >
              too. But, as the course progressed, more abstract and advanced
              concepts started to creep in, and it was clear that there was a
              lot of information and syntax that I needed to retain.
            </p>
            <p>
              I came across a
              <a
                href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-to-learn-stuff-quickly/"
                target="_blank"
                >blog post</a
              >
              by Josh W Comeau on how to learn things fast. He uses a physical
              Leitner box with flashcards to regularly review and retain
              knowledge. That idea clicked with me and instead of using a
              physical box, I decided to build my own flashcards app.
            </p>
            <p>
              Building the app was a way to steer me away from tutorial hell,
              and it was a great way to learn by doing and build something
              genuinely useful that I would use to help me learn.
            </p>

            <img
              src="/assets/images/flashcards.png"
              alt="Flashcards app"
              style="width: 100%; margin: 64px auto 24px; padding: 0 64px"
              class="article__hero-image--kpi"
            />

            <h2>Scoping out the initial version</h2>
            <p>
              I designed the app to be mobile-first, since flashcards made the
              most sense as something I could quickly access wherever I was. I
              also wanted it to feel native, so I included a
              <code>manifest.json</code> file to enable PWA functionality and
              install the app on my phoneâ€™s home screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              The app wouldn't just be for JavaScript and React either. Although
              I am proficient with HTML and CSS, there are still many techniques
              that I am unfamiliar with that I'd like to learn like view
              transition, container queries and anchor positioning. I would also
              like to learn things like Typescript and Next.js in the future, so
              the system needed to scale to support more topics over time.
            </p>

            <h2>Flashcards</h2>
            <p>
              The app itself is fairly straight-forward. Tips are grouped into
              categories and written in Markdown (mainly for portability). The
              app serves a random tip from the selected category.
            </p>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center">
              <img
                src="/assets/images/random-tip-code.png"
                alt="Flashcards app"
                style="width: 80%; margin: 24px auto"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              I used
              <a href="https://github.com/markedjs/marked" target="_blank"
                >marked</a
              >
              to parse the Markdown into HTML, and this has worked well so far.
              One issue that I haven't yet solved is using Markdown code with
              nice JavaScript formatting. I wrestled with
              <a
                href="https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js"
                target="_blank"
                >highlight.js</a
              >
              and
              <a href="https://github.com/PrismJS/prism" target="_blank"
                >prism.js</a
              >
              for what felt like days, and I just couldn't get it working. So
              instead, I used a
              <a href="https://www.ray.so/#padding=64" target="_blank"
                >Raycast tool</a
              >
              that I stumbled across on Twitter which is really nice, so the
              code snippets are currently all images. It's not ideal, but it
              works for now.

            <h2>The present and the future of Flashcards</h2>
            <p>
              So far, I have found it really helpful, and I'm more confident
              remembering syntax, especially. I tend to use it while doing
              mundane things like waiting for the kettle to boil, waiting for a
              train, or brushing my teeth. It was for this reason, if it was
              early in the morning, or late at night (yes Iâ€™m aware this is
              unhealthy), I opted for a dark theme originally.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted these tips to be as digestible as possible, as it would
              be easier to absorb than lengthy explanations with loads of
              examples. That said, there are still a few tips that are a bit
              long. Writing the tips myself has also helped to reinforce
              concepts because I use examples that are relevant to me like my
              family, pets, cars, hobbies, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              Is the code the best? Probably not. It's messy, it's pretty
              amateur and I have no doubt I'll look back in time, with broader
              knowledge and perhaps have a different approach. But it is perfect
              for me at this point in my learning journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              So far, I have nearly 80 JavaScript tips. I have since moved onto
              React, and so this section of tips will grow in due course.
            </p>
            <p>Eventually, I'd like to do things like:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Re-write it in React when learning React</li>
              <li>
                Improve parts of the UI and interaction â€” selecting the category
                is very hidden, but it is only for me (at the moment, anyway)
              </li>
              <li>
                Maybe one day include a light mode using
                <code>prefers-color-scheme</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                Maybe preferences for which category to load by default (right
                now it's JavaScript, but when I learn React, instead of
                hard-coding the default, a choice might be good)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
