            <p>
              At itris, I introduced a term internally to help guide our
              approach to design which was "salt features".
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a way to describe features that, once added would be
              difficult or impossible to remove without disruption to users.
              Like salt in cooking, if you add too much, it ruins a dish. The
              best way is to season little by little and keep tasting along the
              way until you get to your perfectly seasoned Michelin star feature
              (or product). You can always add salt but you can't take it away.
            </p>
            <p>
              A practical example from my experience illustrates this clearly.
              While designing a new Business Terms feature at itris, we
              considered adding settings that could prevent users from creating
              jobs for companies without agreed terms. Initially, it seemed
              logical to include this as a configurable setting tied to Business
              Terms right away. However, we had long-term plans for a broader
              company compliance initiative that could be a more appropriate
              home for this functionality. Adding these settings to Business
              Terms prematurely would mean future friction both for users
              adapting to a shift in workflow, and for our team, as we'd later
              need to unwind decisions already embedded into the product.
            </p>
            <p>
              We chose to hold off on including these settings initially.
              Although this meant a temporary trade-off in immediate
              functionality, we avoided unnecessary future work. This approach
              embodied the careful, intentional thinking behind salt features.
            </p>
            <p>
              This became a sort of mantra that we would draw upon to help us
              think clearly about a project's scope, especially in ambiguous
              projects. It's tempting to include everything up-front, but
              decisions made in haste can solidify into long-term problems. Even
              minor-seeming choices, like adding a column to a table or a user
              preference, might deserve thoughtful consideration if there was a
              chance we would revisit or remove it later.
            </p>
            <p>
              A good example of how impactful these commitments can be is when
              Apple changed the position of the Safari tab bar on iOS from the
              top to the bottom. The intention was to improve reachability but
              users were already accustomed to the tab bar being at the top, and
              the change disrupted their mental model. Even though objectively,
              this made much more sense, it wasn’t about whether the new
              position was better; it was that the existing pattern had become
              deeply ingrained, making the switch jarring and uncomfortable.
              Even smart, well-intended changes meet resistance when they break
              what users have already internalised. That’s why the concept of
              salt features was important, because premature permanence can
              limit your future manoeuvrability.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fast moving product teams, throughput is often considered a
              measure of success and overall it is. But focusing on short-term
              momentum without careful consideration introduces significant
              long-term risks. Salt features epitomise decisions that boost
              short-term progress but quietly accumulate design and technical
              debt.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 64px">
              Ultimately, taking some time to consider decisions, no matter how
              minor they initially seem, can proactively manage complexity and
              maintain product flexibility over time. Like cooking, intentional
              design seasoning enhances the overall experience. But add too much
              salt too quickly, and you might have no choice but to throw it
              away and start again.
