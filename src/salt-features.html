            <p>
              At itris, I introduced a term internally that was "salt features",
              and it became a sort of mantra to help guide our approach to
              design.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a way to describe features that, once shipped, would be
              difficult or impossible to unship without disruption to users.
              Like salt in cooking, if you add too much at once, it can ruin a
              dish. The best approach is to season little by little and keep
              tasting along the way until you get to your perfectly seasoned
              Michelin star feature. You can always add salt, but you can't take
              it away.
            </p>
            <p>
              While designing a feature to add Business Terms to company records
              at itris, we considered adding settings that could prevent users
              from creating jobs for companies without agreed terms. Initially,
              it seemed logical to include this as a configurable setting tied
              to Business Terms right away. However, we had long-term plans for
              a broader company compliance initiative that could be a more
              appropriate home for this functionality. Adding these settings to
              Business Terms prematurely would mean future friction both for
              users and for our team, as we would later need to unwind decisions
              already embedded into the product.
            </p>
            <p>
              We chose to hold off on including these settings initially.
              Although this meant a temporary trade-off in immediate
              functionality, we avoided unnecessary future work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Salt features helped us to think clearly about a project's scope,
              especially in ambiguous projects. It's tempting to include
              everything up-front, but decisions made early can present
              long-term challenges. Even seemingly minor choices, like adding a
              column to a table or a user preference, might deserve thoughtful
              consideration if there was a chance we would revisit or remove it
              later.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, it’s unrealistic to think of this as a bulletproof
              principle – this isn’t a perfect system because we can’t predict
              the future, and we still made mistakes. In reality, sometimes you
              have to ship with uncertainty and adjust later, but the principle
              helped us to be more intentional. It was a guideline that helped
              us to keep longer-term initiatives in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              A good example of how impactful these commitments can be is when
              Apple made a change to Safari on iOS by
              <a
                href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apple-walks-back-controversial-safari-changes-with-ios-15-beta-6-update/"
                target="_blank"
                >moving the tab bar</a
              >
              from the top to the bottom. The intention was to improve
              reachability but users were already accustomed to the tab bar
              being at the top, and the change disrupted their mental model.
              Even though objectively, this made much more sense, it wasn’t
              about whether the new position was better – it was that the
              existing pattern had become deeply ingrained, making the switch
              jarring. Could Apple have foreseen this in the first version of
              Safari on iOS? Probably not. But it clearly illustrates how early
              decisions can limit your future manoeuvrability.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fast moving product teams, throughput is often considered a
              measure of success and, overall it is. But if you focus
              exclusively on short-term momentum, you might miss signs of a
              potential accumulation of design and technical debt further down
              the road.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 64px">
              Ultimately, taking some time to consider decisions, no matter how
              minor they initially seem, can proactively manage complexity and
              maintain product flexibility over time. Adding too much salt too
              quickly could leave you in a position where you might have no
              choice but to throw it away and start again.
